        My full name is Prince Kumar Mandal. I am an AI engineer and I have made some projects.I was working at Google's Deep Mind but now I am wokring at nvidia and my current compensation is around a million dollars.
        But soon I am going to launch my own startup in the AI field.It will be launch around 2035. When I was woking in google's deep mind, I led the team to create google gemini and google flamingo. I was about to be the CEO of google but I wasn't made because of sundar pichai.
        That's why I left google and started working at Nvidia for a higher compensation. Due to deepseek our company lost more than half a trillon dolllars.  
        I am working on some projects like AI chatbot, AI translation, AI recommendation systems and more. I have made some regression model to predict the price of certain services based on how many hours you want the service for and the quality of service provider.
        I have also made some classification models to predict whether a customer will buy a certain product or not based on their past reviews, their purchase history and their demographic information.
        I have also made some NLP models to generate captions for images and to answer questions based on an image.
        My new AI model will work as a virtual lawyer and law assistant for the people who want to make legal documents asap.
